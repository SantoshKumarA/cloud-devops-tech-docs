1. Introduction to Kubernetes at https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS158x+1T2022/home available until end of 2023
2. The Linux Foundation: Introduction to Serverless on Kubernetes at 
Learn how to build serverless functions that can be run on any cloud without being restricted by limits on the execution duration, languages available, or the size of your code.

With the advent of systems like AWS Lambda, the term serverless gained much popularity. However, many people are still unsure what it is for and how it can help them build applications faster than traditional approaches. Other potential users are turned off by the arbitrary limits and lock-in of cloud-based serverless products.

This course will teach you what “serverless” means and how it can be made portable with open source frameworks. You will get a good overview of the CNCF serverless landscape and a first-hand experience in building and deploying code directly to a Kubernetes cluster.

You will build functions using Python and learn how to configure them, manage secrets, add dependencies via pip, learn how to work with binary data and add authentication. In the second part of the course, you will explore the operational side of functions with Kubernetes. This will introduce auto-scaling, metrics, dashboards, and how to expose them securely on the Internet with TLS.

If you are a developer or an IT operator interested in exploring new approaches for building software and prefer to be able to set your own limits when it comes to things like timeouts and choice of programming language, this is the course for you!

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

Understand what serverless is.
Get an overview of the CNCF landscape around serverless technologies.
Learn how serverless can be made portable through the use of the Serverless 2.0 definition and Kubernetes.
Explore the OpenFaaS toolchain, including UI, CLI, and REST API.
Explore the OpenFaaS ecosystem, including the template store and function store for sharing functions and code templates.
Build functions using Python, configure them, and use secrets.
Add dependencies via pip and learn how to build native extensions.
Explore how to operate OpenFaaS with autoscaling, metrics, dashboards, upgrades, custom URLs, and versioning.
Expose functions securely on the Internet with TLS, and secure them with authentication.

Throughout this course, we will explore Serverless together, but the material will not be specific to any one cloud provider. The Serverless we are learning about can be deployed and operated on any computer, whether on-premises, in the cloud, or on your laptop. The functions and platform are made portable through the use of containers and Kubernetes. So, it is only right that we begin by setting the scene with an overview of initiatives within the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), the home and primary sponsor of Kubernetes.

From there, we will set up Kubernetes along with OpenFaaS, an open source platform which is the focus of this course. We will familiarize ourselves with OpenFaaS, starting with its UI, CLI, and its ecosystem - the function store and template store. We will then build and configure functions, think about what it means to operate them, and finally, we will discuss some options for taking it further.

# Notes

Provide a definition of Serverless and FaaS (Function as a Service).
Discuss the differences between functions in the cloud and on Kubernetes.
